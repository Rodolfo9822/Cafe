# Coffee House
The cafe doesn’t exist, I created the brand by myself to improve my HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript skills, moreover, I utilized two APIs Sample APIs and TheMealsDB **Below the text, certainly you can find the API links** to make the menu.

TheMealsDB: https://www.themealdb.com/
Sample APIs: https://sampleapis.com/

In the page reservation and sign up you can fill up the form, so when you send it you can see a message either your data is correct or there are mistakes. But the information won’t be saved in a database.
**The history is fake because I asked Chat GPT to build on a fake business history**
